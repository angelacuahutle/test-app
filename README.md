## Roadmap

#### Technology and gems 

##### The exercise consists of writing a Ruby on Rails application.

- Rails 7..2
- Ruby 3.1.0
- mysql 8
- Tailwind
- slim view templates


- A single page application
- Displaying in its landing page (home page), a table with the following columns:
Teacher                School                   School Year
- Table is centered horizontally in the home page. 
- Column heads row is blue background with white font.
- Cells have blue borders and light gray background.
- Default # of rows is 25.
- Below the table, you have pagination.
- Each table head column is clickable (with an up/down arrow showing next to it) to 
- Change the sort direction, based on that column.
- The table must be done using Hotwire/Stimulus/TurboFrame, on the front end, without having to go back to the server to refresh the screen, or using any JS libraries (such as datatables).
- Add a search box.
